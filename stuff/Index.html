            For thousands of years, what is now known as Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Indigenous tribes. The
            first settlement of non-indigenous people in Kansas occurred in 1827 at Fort Leavenworth. The pace of
            settlement accelerated in the 1850s, in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate. When it was
            officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act, conflict
            between abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri broke
            out over the question of whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state, in a period known as
            Bleeding Kansas. On January 29, 1861,[17][18] Kansas entered the Union as a free state, hence the unofficial
            nickname "The Free State". Passage of the Homestead Acts in 1862 brought a further influx of settlers, and
            the booming cattle trade of the 1870s attracted some of the Wild West's most iconic figures to western
            Kansas.
